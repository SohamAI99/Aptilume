## Prerequisites

1. A Vercel account
2. Firebase project with:
   - Firestore Database
   - Authentication enabled
   - Firebase Admin SDK service account key

## Frontend Deployment

### Environment Variables

Set the following environment variables in your Vercel project settings:

```
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_firebase_auth_domain
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_firebase_project_id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_firebase_storage_bucket
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_firebase_messaging_sender_id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_firebase_app_id
VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your_firebase_measurement_id
```

### Build Settings

- Build Command: `npm run build`
- Output Directory: `build`
- Install Command: `npm install`

## Backend Deployment

### Environment Variables

For the backend API to work, you need to set the following environment variable in Vercel:

```
FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT={"type":"service_account","project_id":"your_project_id","private_key_id":"your_private_key_id","private_key":"-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\\nYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY\\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\\n","client_email":"your_client_email","client_id":"your_client_id","auth_uri":"https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth","token_uri":"https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token","auth_provider_x509_cert_url":"https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs","client_x509_cert_url":"your_client_x509_cert_url"}
```

Note: The FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT value should be a single-line JSON string with escaped newlines.

### API Routes

The backend API will be available at:
- `/api/users/*` - User management
- `/api/quizzes/*` - Quiz management
- `/api/attempts/*` - Quiz attempts
- `/api/results/*` - Quiz results
- `/api/ai/*` - AI features
- `/health` - Health check endpoint

## Deployment Steps

1. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
2. Set the environment variables as described above
3. Configure the build settings:
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `build`
4. Deploy!

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Firebase connection errors**: Ensure your Firebase service account is correctly configured
2. **Environment variables not found**: Check that all required environment variables are set in Vercel
3. **Build failures**: Make sure your `build` directory is correctly generated by the build process

### Checking Deployment Status

You can check the status of your deployment by:
1. Visiting your Vercel dashboard
2. Checking the deployment logs
3. Testing the `/health` endpoint of your API
