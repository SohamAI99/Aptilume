# Resource Integration Instructions

## PDF Files Successfully Integrated

The PDF files have been successfully located and copied to the correct directory:

1. `Quant-Short-Tricks-PDF.pdf` has been copied to `public/pdfs/Quantitative_Aptitude_Basics.pdf`
2. `50-Coding-Interview-Questions.pdf` has been copied to `public/pdfs/Coding_Interview_Preparation.pdf`

## Testing the Integration

To test that the integration is working properly:

1. Start your development server
2. Navigate to the Resources page in your application
3. Find the "Quantitative Aptitude Basics" and "Coding Interview Preparation" resources
4. Click the "Access" button for each PDF
5. The PDFs should open in a new browser tab

## Technical Details

The resources page has been updated to:
- Link directly to local PDF files instead of using placeholder links
- Remove the "Back to Dashboard" button as requested
- Handle PDF access through a dedicated function that opens PDFs in a new tab
- Maintain all existing functionality for other resource types (videos, articles)

## File Locations

- Resources page: `src/pages/student-dashboard/resources/index.jsx`
- PDF storage: `public/pdfs/` (folder created and populated)
- PDF access URLs: 
  - `/pdfs/Quantitative_Aptitude_Basics.pdf`
  - `/pdfs/Coding_Interview_Preparation.pdf`

## Troubleshooting

If the PDFs don't open when you click "Access":
1. Verify the PDF files are in the correct folder (`public/pdfs/`)
2. Check that the file names match exactly (case-sensitive)
3. Ensure your development server is running
4. Check the browser console for any errors

The integration is now complete and ready to use!
