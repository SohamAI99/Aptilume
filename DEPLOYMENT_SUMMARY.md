# Deployment Summary

This document summarizes all the changes made to make the Aptilume project ready for deployment on Vercel.

## Changes Made

### 1. Configuration Files

#### vercel.json (Root)
- Created to configure Vercel deployment
- Specifies build settings for frontend (static build with `build` directory)
- Configures routing for API endpoints

#### vercel.json (Server)
- Created to configure server-side deployment
- Specifies Node.js runtime for backend functions

#### firebase.json
- Updated `public` directory from `dist` to `build` to match Vite configuration

### 2. Environment Configuration

#### Firebase Admin SDK
- Created `server/utils/firebaseAdmin.js` to handle Firebase initialization for both local and Vercel environments
- Updated `server/config/firebase.js` to use the new utility
- Added support for Vercel environment variables

### 3. API Routes for Vercel

Created Vercel-compatible API routes in the `api/` directory:

Each API route:
- Handles CORS headers
- Supports all HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Includes proper error handling
- Integrates with Firebase Admin SDK

### 4. Documentation

#### VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT.md
- Created comprehensive deployment guide for Vercel
- Includes environment variable setup
- Provides build and deployment instructions
- Contains troubleshooting tips

#### Updated README.md
- Added Vercel deployment section
- Linked to detailed deployment documentation

### 5. Deployment Scripts

#### Updated package.json
- Added `deploy` script to package.json

#### Updated deploy.js
- Enhanced deployment script to support both Firebase and Vercel
- Added command-line argument support (`firebase` or `vercel`)

## Deployment Instructions

### Frontend Deployment

1. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
2. Set the following environment variables in Vercel project settings:
   ```
   VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
   VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_firebase_auth_domain
   VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_firebase_project_id
   VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_firebase_storage_bucket
   VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_firebase_messaging_sender_id
   VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_firebase_app_id
   VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your_firebase_measurement_id
   ```
3. Configure build settings:
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `build`

### Backend Deployment

1. Set the following environment variable in Vercel project settings:
   ```
   FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT={"type":"service_account","project_id":"your_project_id","private_key_id":"your_private_key_id","private_key":"-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\\nYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY\\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\\n","client_email":"your_client_email","client_id":"your_client_id","auth_uri":"https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth","token_uri":"https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token","auth_provider_x509_cert_url":"https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs","client_x509_cert_url":"your_client_x509_cert_url"}
   ```
   
   Note: The FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT value should be a single-line JSON string with escaped newlines.

### Deployment Commands

```bash
# Deploy to Firebase
npm run deploy firebase

# Deploy to Vercel
npm run deploy vercel
```

## API Endpoints

Once deployed, the following API endpoints will be available:

- `GET /api` - API information
- `GET /api/health` - Health check
- `GET /api/users` - List all users
- `GET /api/users?id={userId}` - Get user by ID
- `POST /api/users` - Create user
- `PUT /api/users?id={userId}` - Update user
- `DELETE /api/users?id={userId}` - Delete user

Similar endpoints exist for:
- `/api/quizzes`
- `/api/attempts`
- `/api/results`
- `/api/ai`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Firebase connection errors**: Ensure your Firebase service account is correctly configured
2. **Environment variables not found**: Check that all required environment variables are set in Vercel
3. **Build failures**: Make sure your `build` directory is correctly generated by the build process

### Checking Deployment Status

You can check the status of your deployment by:
1. Visiting your Vercel dashboard
2. Checking the deployment logs
3. Testing the `/api/health` endpoint of your API

## Next Steps

1. Set up your Firebase project and obtain the necessary credentials
2. Configure environment variables in Vercel
3. Deploy your application using the Vercel dashboard or CLI
4. Test all API endpoints to ensure they're working correctly
5. Verify that the frontend can communicate with the backend API
