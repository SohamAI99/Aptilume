# Exam Interface Update Summary

This document summarizes all the changes made to enhance the exam interface with fullscreen monitoring and toggle functionality.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Fullscreen Monitoring
Updated the [FullscreenMonitor.jsx](file:///c:/Users/soham/OneDrive/Desktop/ALL%20PROJECTS/Rocket/aptilume/aptilume/src/pages/exam-interface/components/FullscreenMonitor.jsx) component with:

1. **Video Fullscreen Check**:
   - Added `isVideoInFullscreen()` function as requested
   - Modified fullscreen checking logic to account for video elements in fullscreen mode
   - Updated violation detection to ignore exits when a video is in fullscreen

2. **Toggle Button**:
   - Added a toggle button in the top-right corner to switch between proctoring info and question blocks view
   - Added icons for better visual indication of the current view
   - Implemented `onToggleView` callback to communicate with the parent component

### 2. Updated Exam Interface
Modified the [exam-interface/index.jsx](file:///c:/Users/soham/OneDrive/Desktop/ALL%20PROJECTS/Rocket/aptilume/aptilume/src/pages/exam-interface/index.jsx) component with:

1. **Toggle State Management**:
   - Added `showProctoringInfo` state to track the current view
   - Implemented `handleToggleView` function to switch between views

2. **Responsive Layout**:
   - Restructured the layout to use a grid system with a main content area and sidebar
   - Moved proctoring information and question blocks to the sidebar
   - Made the layout responsive for different screen sizes

3. **Dynamic Sidebar Content**:
   - Created `renderProctoringInfo()` to display proctoring-related information
   - Created `renderQuestionBlocks()` to display the question navigation grid
   - Added visual indicators for answered questions and current question

### 3. Files Modified

1. **[src/pages/exam-interface/components/FullscreenMonitor.jsx](file:///c:/Users/soham/OneDrive/Desktop/ALL%20PROJECTS/Rocket/aptilume/aptilume/src/pages/exam-interface/components/FullscreenMonitor.jsx)**
   - Added `isVideoInFullscreen()` function
   - Modified fullscreen checking logic
   - Added toggle button with icons
   - Added `showProctoringInfo` and `onToggleView` props

2. **[src/pages/exam-interface/index.jsx](file:///c:/Users/soham/OneDrive/Desktop/ALL%20PROJECTS/Rocket/aptilume/aptilume/src/pages/exam-interface/index.jsx)**
   - Added toggle state management
   - Implemented responsive grid layout
   - Created dynamic sidebar content rendering
   - Updated component structure to accommodate the new layout

## Features Implemented

### 1. Video Fullscreen Support
The fullscreen monitor now properly handles cases where a video element is in fullscreen mode, preventing false violation detections.

### 2. Toggle Between Views
Users can now toggle between:
- **Proctoring Info View**: Shows violation count, time remaining, and proctoring status
- **Question Blocks View**: Shows a grid of all questions with visual indicators for answered questions

### 3. Enhanced User Experience
- Improved layout with a dedicated sidebar for supplementary information
- Visual indicators for current question and answered questions
- Responsive design that works on different screen sizes
- Clear toggle button with icons for intuitive navigation

## How It Works

1. **Fullscreen Monitoring**:
   - When the exam starts, the component automatically enters fullscreen mode
   - Continuously monitors fullscreen status every second
   - Detects when user exits fullscreen (unless a video is in fullscreen)
   - Tracks tab switching as violations
   - Shows warnings for violations and auto-submits after 3 violations

2. **View Toggle**:
   - Toggle button in the top-right corner switches between views
   - Proctoring Info view shows monitoring status and exam details
   - Question Blocks view shows a grid for quick navigation between questions
   - Visual indicators show which questions have been answered

3. **Question Navigation**:
   - Clicking on question numbers in the grid navigates to that question
   - Current question is highlighted in the grid
   - Answered questions have a different visual style

## Verification

To verify the changes:

1. Start the application: `npm start`
2. Navigate to an exam
3. After entering the exam interface:
   - You should see a toggle button in the top-right corner
   - The sidebar should show proctoring information by default
   - Clicking the toggle button should switch to the question blocks view
   - Clicking on question numbers should navigate to those questions
   - Fullscreen monitoring should work as before, with the addition of video fullscreen support

The implementation maintains all existing functionality while adding the requested features for a better exam experience.
